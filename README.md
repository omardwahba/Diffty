# 🤖 Diffty: The Web-Controlled Mobile Robot 🚀

**Diffty** is a web-controlled mobile robot built on the Robot Operating System (ROS). It's designed to help transport things and humans in closed areas with ease and efficiency. Diffty establishes a low-latency connection with the user via WebSocket protocols and streams video frames captured through its camera in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Web-Controlled**: Control Diffty remotely through a web interface.
- **Real-Time Video Streaming**: Stream video frames captured through Diffty's camera.
- **Low-Latency Communication**: Utilizes WebSocket protocols for quick and responsive interactions.
- **Human & Object Transportation**: Designed to transport objects and humans within closed environments.

## 🛠️ Toolkits

Diffty is built using the following toolkits and technologies:

- **ROS**: The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the core framework for Diffty's operations.
- **ROSWeb Bridge**: Enables communication between ROS and web technologies.
- **RosSerial**: Provides a protocol for integrating microcontrollers with ROS.
- **Gmapping**: Used for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
- **NodeJS**: Server-side JavaScript environment for handling web requests and WebSocket connections.
- **RoslibJS**: JavaScript library for interacting with ROS from the web.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing and computer vision.
- **Gazebo**: Simulation environment for testing and developing robot models.

## 🖥️ Web Interface

Diffty's web interface allows for intuitive control and monitoring. Here are some of the features you can access:

- **Joystick Control**: Move Diffty around with a virtual joystick.
- **Camera Feed**: View real-time video from Diffty's camera.
- **Status Monitoring**: Keep track of Diffty's battery life, speed, and other vital stats.
